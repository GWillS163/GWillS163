  The following is my favorite poem, its philosophy as my thought, create by a dev in GitHub.
  </a>
  <hr>
  <p>
    <em>
    The more I draw and write,</br>   
    the more I realise that accidents are a necessary part of any creative act,</br>  
    much more so than logic or wisdom.</br>   
    Sometimes a mistake is the only way of arriving at an original concept,</br>  
    and the history of successful inventions is full of mishaps,</br>  
    <strong>serendipity</strong> and unintended results.</br>  
    - Shaun Tan
